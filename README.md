# Manager Readme
## What is this?

Hello!

This is my [Manager README](https://matthewnewkirk.com/2017/09/20/share-your-manager-readme/), I have taken inspiration for this document from various references found on the internet (see references). This read me is a convenient way to introduce myself and how I manage. 

The intended audience is primarily anyone who reports in to me, although anyone is free to read and provide feedback. Please treat it as a reference on how I will conduct myself as a manager, and what I require from my reports.

`Disclaimer: This document applies to my personal management style, and is not official company policy`

## My Job
#### I am primarily here to do three things:

1. To provide context
2. Engage, retain, and grow world-class talent
3. Manage and Build a well functioning engineering team

## How I approach my job
I believe in collaboration and open mindedness. You are the expert, I lean on you to help me make the best holistic decisions I can for the team, for any project I lead, and for the company as a whole. 

My teams come first, with out a well staffed, and well functioning team, I will be unable to do the job, the product will fail, our company and their clients will not flourish. It is my top priority to keep my reports well watered with plenty of sun light so they're supported to do their tasks and ultimately, their job.

## My Goals
If I accomplish my goals it means that:

* You feel empowered as a leader to figure out what you need to do and how you think it should be done and then to get it done
* You have enough context to understand your priority and focus over the next month or quarter
* You have built effective relationships with others in the company
* We have a clear roadmap

## The Team
If I describe my ideal for our team and each person on it, it is that we:

* Take control of, and responsibility for, our own destiny
* Have each other’s back
* Hold each other accountable
* Expect excellence in ourselves and each other
* Assume positive intent
* Always question, always ask “why?”
* Constantly learn
* Laugh together

## Scheduling
* You are always welcome and encouraged to drop a meeting on my calendar, either via Google Calendar or https://calendly.com/cnewfeldt
* If you want or need to talk to me, and my schedule is not open, DM me on Slack and I’ll make sure we talk that day.

## Comms
* Nothing beats face-to-face in-person communication
* Our next best option is face-to-face video
* I respond to emails within 24 hours, and usually within three.
* If it feels like we’re having trouble communicating, I will always err on the side of, “let’s hop on a video call and hash this out”
* I try to be as responsive as possible via Slack

## 1-1s (One-on-ones)
* 1-1s are very important to me because they are dedicated space for you to talk about anything and everything you want; what would you like to talk about? What’s going well? What’s bugging you?
* They are meetings primarily for you, and only secondarily for me
* It’s not a status meeting, unless you want to talk about status
* 1-1s are flexible -- they can shift and change to fit around our shifting schedules
* Don’t save urgent matters for a 1-1!
* If I have feedback, I will also provide it during this time.

## Feedback
* More than any other factor, candid and compassionate feedback is central to a cohesive high-functioning team
* Feedback is best received in the context of psychological safety; I want you to know, both intellectually and experientially, that my primary desire is for you to be happy and fulfilled
* Feedback should happen as real-time as possible
	* I will strive for this
	* In a distributed company, the “normal” post-meeting chats don’t happen; we need to be intentional

## Performance
* We follow the company defined performance assessment and communication model. My goal is for you to always know where you’re at. If you ever feel you don’t know, just ask me.

Note: 

* If matters are not going well, I am always open to making it right. Any concerns are absolutely recoverable, and recovering from difficult periods builds trust. If you can accept feedback, acknowledge your role in the situation, and are willing and capable of changing, growing, and improving, any matter of performance can be worked out.
